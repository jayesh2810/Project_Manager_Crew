# Project_Manager_Crew

Project Manager Crew is an intelligent, agent-based system that automates the planning, budgeting, and timeline creation for hardware or electronics design projects. Powered by CrewAI and LangChain, it uses LLMs to simulate a real-world project manager capable of handling multi-phase design workflows, real-time research, and estimation tasks.

Features:
- Autonomous Agent: Simulates a project manager capable of researching, planning, and delegating.
- Live Research: Uses SerperDev tool to search the web and fetch real-time data (e.g., prices from Digikey, Mouser).
- Cost Planning: Estimates hardware and manpower budgets with detailed breakdowns.
- Timeline Estimation:
- Calculates phase durations, dependencies, and risk buffers
- Outputs a Gantt-style schedule
